## Learning to Predict Localized Distortions in Rendered Images

In this work, we present a new data-driven full-reference image quality metric which outperforms current state-of-the-art metrics. The metric was trained on subjective ground truth data combining two publicly available datasets. For the sake of completeness we create a new testing synthetic dataset including experimentally measured subjective distortion maps. Finally, using the same machine-learning framework we optimize the parameters of popular existing metrics.
